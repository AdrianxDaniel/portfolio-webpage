            <p id="about-me" style="font-size: 18px;">
                I consider myself a dynamic individual with a wide range of interests and a resilient attitude towards
                life's challenges.
                Despite facing setbacks in my academic journey, such as not being accepted into my school's Nursing
                Program due to its
                limited spots and a huge applicant pool, I've always remained determined and focused on my goals. My
                educational background
                spans across Criminal Justice and Nursing, and I've gained valuable experience in the logistics industry
                over the past
                eight years. In my current role, I take pride in meticulously managing logistics operations, ensuring
                smooth cargo flow,
                and addressing any issues that arise along the way. However, beyond my professional endeavors, my true
                passion lies in
                the realm of creativity and technology. I often find myself immersed in brainstorming ideas for games
                and contemplating
                ways to enhance existing ones. This passion has led me to embark on a journey to learn programming, as I
                believe it holds
                the key to realizing my dreams of bringing my imaginative ideas to life. Furthermore, I've always viewed
                myself as someone
                with a strong temperament. While some may perceive a strong temper as easily getting agitated, I see it
                as the ability to maintain
                composure and channel emotions into productive outcomes. This trait has helped me navigate life's ups
                and downs with resilience and grace.
